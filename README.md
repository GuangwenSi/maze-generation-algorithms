### Introduction

A software that generates different kind of mazes with variable height and width. The generated mazes can be saved as an image.

### How it works

***[Demonstration videos on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwIV1dqznwSfvkh5YVYF3ioumOVpMR9KV)***

There are six different algorithms (in implementation order):
- Binary tree [[1]](#references)
- Recursive backtracking [[2]](#references)
- Recursive division [[3]](#references)
- Prim's [[4]](#references)
- Aldous-Broder [[5]](#references)
- Kruskal's [[6]](#references)

The references has clear explanation about how the algorithms work, I won't go into details. My code is also fully commented, so it's good reference too.

#### File structure

The folder structure can be seen below.
```bash

Details about the important folders and files:

- common:
  - main: Main() function.
  - file_system: Saves/loads the maze as an image.
  - maze_generator: Base class for every other class.
- design: Pictures needed by this readme.
- makefile: Generates the target.
- mazes: Every maze generation algorithm (and class) in their own subfolder.
- output: Pictures generated by the software.


#### Maze generators

A maze is represented by a **vector<vector<uint32_t>>**, where 0 is a hole or passage, and 1 is a wall.

Every algorithm has its own class and a common base class, called maze_generator.

Each class has the following public methods:

| Method      | Purpose                                                                       |
| ---         | ---                                                                           |
| constructor | Creates the 2D vector with the given height and width.                        |
| get_cell    | Returns the value of the cell.                                                |
| set_cell    | Manually changes the value of a cell (turns it into a wall (1) or a hole(0).  |
| get_maze    | Returns the maze as a 2D vector.                                              |
| set_maze    | Manually overwrites the whole maze.                                           |
| reshape     | Changes the height and width of the maze.                                     |
| generate    | Does the actual generation.                                                   |

The first six methods are inherited from the base class, the last is different for every algorithm.

#### Main and file_system

The main function is a demo, that demonstrates how the generator is working. It asks for width, height and algorithm for the generation.
After these, it saves the maze as a \*.png image. 

The file_system file and class has a save and load method. The save, as its name shows saves me maze. It uses OpenCV to convert the vector-vector into an actual image. It turns every wall into a black cell, every hole into a white cell, and everything else into red. The method also resizes the image, makes it 20 times bigger, for visibility porpuse.
The load method works the same way, but does the opposite, loads an image and turns it into a vector-vector.

### How to use it

If you are only interested in reusing the classes/algorithms, then read the previous chapter and the comments inside the code.

If you would like to use the actual software:
Make sure, that you have gcc, which support c++14 and OpenCV.
I have the following, but older/newer versions might be good too:
```
gcc version 5.4.0
GNU Make 4.1
OpenCV 4.0.0
```
If you have everything, then clone the repo, get into the root folder and build:
```
make all
```
If it worked, then run:
```
./maze_generator
```
Enjoy!

There is also 
```
make clean
```
and
```
make clean_output
```
First one is the normal clean, the second one clears the output folder.
