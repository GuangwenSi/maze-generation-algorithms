### Introduction

A software that generates and solves different kind of mazes with variable height and width. There are a lot of supporting features. Also, the generated mazes can be saved/loaded as an image.

### How it works

The references have clear explanation about how the algorithms work, I won't go into details. Also, my code is fully commented, so it's good reference too.

#### Maze generators

A maze is represented by a **vector<vector<uint32_t>>**, where 0 is a hole or passage, 1 is a wall and 2 is solution.

Every algorithm has its own class and a common base class, called maze_generator.

Each class has the following public methods:

| Method      | Purpose                                                                       |
| ---         | ---                                                                           |
| constructor | Creates the 2D vector with the given height and width.                        |
| get_cell    | Returns the value of the cell.                                                |
| set_cell    | Manually changes the value of a cell (turns it into a wall (1) or a hole(0).  |
| get_maze    | Returns the maze as a 2D vector.                                              |
| set_maze    | Manually overwrites the whole maze.                                           |
| reshape     | Changes the height and width of the maze.                                     |
| generate    | Does the actual generation.                                                   |

The first six methods are inherited from the base class, the last is different for every algorithm.

#### Maze solvers

The solving algorithms are way simpler, than the generators. There are only one class (solver) and every algorithm is a single method.

#### Main

The main function is a demo that demonstrates how the generator is working. It asks for width, height and algorithm for the generation. After the selected input parameters, the software generates it and then solves it.
Finally the the generated and solved mazes are saved in the output folder as \*.png image.

#### File_system

The file_system class has a save and load method. The save, as its name shows, saves me maze. It uses OpenCV to convert the vector-vector into an actual image. It turns every wall into a black cell, every hole into a white cell, and everything else into red. The method also resizes the image, makes it 20 times bigger, for visibility purpose.
The load method works the same way, but does the opposite, loads an image and turns it into a vector-vector.

### How to use it

If you are only interested in reusing the classes/algorithms, then read the previous chapter and the comments inside the code.

If you would like to use the actual software:
Make sure, that you have gcc, which support c++14 and OpenCV.
I have the following, but older/newer versions might be good too:
```
gcc version 5.4.0
GNU Make 4.1
OpenCV 4.0.0
```
If you have everything, then clone the repository, get into the root folder and build:
```
make
```
If it worked, then run:
```
./maze_generator
```
Enjoy!

There is also 
```
make clean
```
and
```
make clean_output
```
First one is the normal clean, the second one clears the output folder.
